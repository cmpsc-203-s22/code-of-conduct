### Attendance

Attendance is an important part of the teamwork this class requires. Students are responsible for ensuring they arrive to class on time and prepared for the day's activities. Students are also responsible for staying on track in regards to assignments and communicating with the professor early and often about potential absences.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not arrive late to class or labs unless they have a valid excuse.
- Students should not be absent from class or lab unless it is an excused absence, or if you have communicated the situation with the professor.
- Students should make their best effort to not come to book club class sessions without reading the assigned readings beforehand.

### Deadlines

Similar to meeting attendance requirements,  meeting deadlines is extremely important. Ensuring work is done on time, if not earlier, is vital to staying on track for the semester and keeping your group moving forward. Work should be submitted before deadlines and with time for reviews to be conducted and edits to be made. Extensions should be requested early if conflicts are likely to arise.
