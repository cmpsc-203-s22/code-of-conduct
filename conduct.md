### Conflicts

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Openness. It is important to be vulnerable in your group so that they understand your strengths and weaknesses within coding. Being open will help your team members know what you are capable of doing so they do not assign you something that you would not understand. This could prevent confusion and reserve time. Being open can also allow your team members to help you with problems with your code that you did not catch or understand.
- Retaining team members ideas. This is a form of respecting everyone's thoughts and opinions. This means to keep or reserve someones idea to let your teammates know that they are heard within the group and their opinions matter.
- Encourage humility. Being humble is an important trait when working in a team. It is important for everyone in a team to understand that it is not about one person but that it is about the whole team. Realizing this can avoid conflicts because software engineering is a team effort in which everyone needs each other to properly finish a project.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Resentment. To resent means to feel anger or bitterness towards someone. This will disrupt the flow of the team and can lead to miscommunication and/or using inappropriate language. This a selfish act and is not respecting the group. It causes tension increases conflicts.
- Lack of Communication and miscommunication. Within a group, communication is key to keep the team on track. One way to practice good communication is by giving good criticism to your teammates. When reviewing their code, tell them what they should or should not do but in a respectful way to prevent miscommunication. Tell them what you like that they did and suggest what you think would be best.
- Ego. Software engineering is a team effort so having an big ego can disrupt the workflow of the group and leave them feeling less important which is not respectful to others.
