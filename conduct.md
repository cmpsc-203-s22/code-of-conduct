# Conduct Guide for Software Engineering

## Categories of Conduct

### Overall Conduct

Overall conduct is the general way students are expected to behave during any interaction within this class.  To be successful, students should read and follow all parts of the conduct guide.  Aside from this guide, students should abide by the Honor Code for all submitted work and adhere to the three pillars--humility, respect, and trust--in all aspects of this course.  

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should be respectful to the professor and peers.
- Students should finish work on time and ask for help if it is needed.
- Students should be attentive in class and utilize the material to finish assignments.
- Students should come to class having done the readings and be prepared to engage in discussions or activities.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not disparage others or prevent others from expressing opinions.
- Students should not take criticism personally and should provide constructive criticism to others.
- Students should not do group work that is already assigned to other team members.

### Attendance

Attending class is vital to learning and critical to the teamwork this course requires. Because of this, attendance is factored into a student's overall grade in this course. Students are responsible for ensuring they arrive to class on time and prepared for the day's activities.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should arrive to class sessions, practical sessions, and lab sessions on time. These times are:
  - Class Session: Monday and Wednesday from 10:40 am - 11:40 am
  - Practical Session: Friday from 10:40 am - 11:40 am
  - Laboratory Session: Tuesday from 2:50 pm - 4:40 pm
- Students should give at least one week prior notice if they will be late to class, have conflicts with other classes, or will be absent before the class begins.
- Students should come to class prepared by completing labs, completing practicals, and reading Discord to know any information needed for lessons.
- Students who are late should check in with the professor and their classmates after class in order to stay caught up with work.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not arrive late to class or labs unless they have a valid excuse.
- Students should not be absent from class or lab unless it is an excused absence or if you have communicated the situation with the professor.
- Students should not come to book club class sessions without reading the assigned materials beforehand.

### Deadlines

Meeting deadlines is extremely important and ensuring that work is completed on time, if not earlier, is vital to staying on track for the semester and keeping your group moving forward. Work should be submitted before deadlines and with time for reviews to be conducted and edits to be made.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should submit their work before the given deadline.
- Students should contact the professor and make special arrangements for their assignments if they have conflicts/emergencies.
- Students should be aware of deadlines and get assistance for assignments prior to end of deadlines.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not forget to be mindful of assignment due dates and work on them accordingly.
- Students should not request an extension unless they are facing a serious and extenuating circumstance.
- Students should not forget to contact the professor as soon as possible when they have a situation where they need an extension.

### Communication

Communication is key to both successful and sustainable code. However, it is important that all communication between students and team members follows the three pillars of Respect, Trust, and Humility. In general, students will *respect* their peers, *trust* their contributions and thoughts, and practice *humility* in all aspects of communication, in person, on GitHub, in the Discord, and otherwise.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should communicate in a professional and respectful manner.
- Students should use words like "Please" and "Thank you".
- Students will allow other members and teams to speak freely.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not communicate in a way that offends or disrespects others.
- Students should not interrupt others--we all have something to share.
- Students should not show signs of passive aggressive behavior.

### Participation

Participation for students will be based on a multitude of factors. We all have bad days and we all have topics we know more or less about, but how many times a student speaks a day will not solely make up their participation. It is being prepared each day, having done the prerequisite work, coming to class with an open mind to learn, and making an effort to be a part of either small group or large group conversations that will reflect students participation.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students will respect all peers' opinions.
- Students will show up to every class ready to learn and engage with the class.
- Students will evaluate their own participation and the participation of their group members by completing the participation surveys at the end of each week.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students will not interrupt their peers.
- Students will not skip reading or assignments.
- Students will not disrespect peer contributions in work, code, speech, or otherwise by, for example, ignoring certain students in their group or belittling the ideas of others.

### Decisions

Decisions are the process by which team members collectively discuss their project ideas, define their goals, analyze problems, and make plans to achieve the goal. Teams must have a clearly defined process for making decisions before they start their projects so that they can effectively communicate with each other and make important decisions that enable them to write successful and sustainable software.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Teams should finalize decisions when the team reaches a majority vote.
- Teams should consider and discuss all possible ideas of each student before moving forward.
- Teams should document how they reached the final decisions.
- Teams should make space for quieter voices on the team to speak.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not talk over others or prevent others from submitting their ideas.
- Students should not commit and push code that falls outside of the group's initial intent for a project.
- Students should not update documentation or code in ways that are inconsistent with the decisions made by the team.
- Students should not take final decisions personally.

### Postmortems

Postmortems are an evaluation of performances after implementation. The goal is to identify what worked and what did not and describe what needed to be done differently. When a postmortem is done correctly, all team members should have a better understanding of how to avoid the same mistakes in future projects.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should reflect on what went right or wrong with a particular process.
- Students should provide constructive feedback based on their reflections.
- Students should document these findings and amend the process to prevent the same mistakes.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should avoid omitting failures and should detail the causes for errors.
- Students should not direct the blame for failures on any particular person.
- Students should not write vaguely about failures or mention an issue without going into detail.

### Conflicts

When a conflict between students arises, it is imperative to deal with the situation in a respectful, yet effective way.
Communication is a great tool to prevent or defuse conflicts between students, team members, or teams as a whole. According
to Conway's Law, the final product mirrors the methods of communication that went into the product's development. So if
conflicts occur and prevent communication, it will likely lower the quality of the final product. For these reasons, it is
crucial to adhere to the codes of conduct relating to conflicts that are outlined below.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should first try to resolve conflicts amongst themselves, practicing humility, respect, and trust.
- Students should talk out the conflict amongst their teammates.
- Students should address the conflict as soon as it arises.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not needlessly escalate the conflict.
- Students should not refuse to resolve the conflict.
- Students should not purposely cause conflicts.

### Infractions

Infractions are violations of the class conduct guide as specified by the unacceptable conduct sections. It is important that the conduct guide is upheld and acceptable conduct is followed in order to support a positive learning environment in the class and online.

When a violation is committed, the student is given a penalty for the total amount of violations committed during the semester.  The only exception to this is that Honor Code violations, and the penalties associated with them, are handled and investigated by the Honor Committee.

If you believe that a violation was reported incorrectly or unfairly, it is possible to meet with the professor teaching the class to discuss a possible appeal for the violation.  After discussion, the professor will make the final decision about the violation.

Depending on the total amount of violations, the penalty given is decided based on a leveled system as follows:

#### Level 1 Infraction

Students who commit one violation will be recorded by the professor and warned orally.

#### Level 2 Infraction

Students who commit violations 3 times or more will be required to have a meeting with the professor to talk about their current infractions and develop a plan to avoid future ones.

#### Level 3 Infraction

Students who commit violations 5 times in total or avoid meeting with the professor after a level 2 infraction will have points deducted from their grade on the current assignment.
