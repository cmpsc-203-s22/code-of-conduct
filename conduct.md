### Conflicts

When a conflict between students arises, it is imperative to deal with the situation in a respectful, yet effective way.
Communication is a great tool to prevent or defuse conflicts between students, team members, or teams as a whole. According
to Conway's Law, the final product mirrors the methods of communication that went into the product's development. So if
conflicts occur and prevent communication, it will likely lower the quality of the final product. For these reasons, it is
crucial to adhere to the codes of conduct relating to conflicts that are outlined below.

Students who commit one violation will be recorded by the professor and warned orally.

Students who commit violations 3 times or more in total will be required to have a meeting with the professor to talk about their current infractions and develop a plan to avoid future ones.

#### Level 3 Infraction

Students who commit violations 5 times in total or avoid meeting with the professor after a level 2 infraction will have points deducted from their grade on the current assignment.
